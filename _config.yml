  I am currently pursuing a Master's in Finance at Tsinghua University, having completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My undergraduate academic journey spans multiple fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and time series analysis, with publications in these areas.

  As a Quantitative Research Intern now, I apply deep learning techniques to quantitative modeling and factor discovery. With great enthusiasm and confidence in the development of LLM and AI technologies, I actively keep pace with the latest AI advancements.

  I am open to opportunities in Quantitative Research (QR) and Large Language Models (LLM), and I’m always excited to connect with others, whether to collaborate or just for a friendly chat. Feel free to reach out to me via WeChat (Elon\_Yin) or email at [yinelon@gmail.com](mailto:yinelon@gmail.com).

          This research introduces two new evaluation metrics for multimodal learning: **BagelScore**, which improves image-text alignment by leveraging unified multimodal models, and **EditingScore**, designed to assess image editing quality based on transformation difficulty in generative models. These metrics address the limitations of existing approaches, offering a more principled, reasoning-based evaluation.

          **CtrlVSR** is a video super-resolution method that forecasts high-resolution frames by leveraging motion cues. The model encodes low-resolution frames and motion data, then generates enhanced outputs with controllable adjustments like sharpening or blur removal. CtrlVSR achieves superior results on 4K and 8K footage, offering flexibility without requiring ultra-high-resolution training data.

          This research presents a vision-based approach that abandons text and allows visual features to communicate through a graph of image prototypes. Using self-supervised learning, the model uncovers emergent semantic structures, where meaning is determined purely by vision. Text is only used for interpretation, not during training. This method demonstrates that vision alone can recognize and name the world without relying on textual input.

          This work introduces **OGDiff**, a novel OSDG framework that replaces expensive second-order meta-learning with a conditional diffusion process. This avoids inner-loop backpropagation, reducing computational costs and improving stability. The **MSDFF** module is also introduced to better capture both fine- and coarse-grained features, enhancing recognition of known and unknown classes.

          Based on MF-DFA and multi-peak analysis, the multifractality of LNG spot freight rates was verified, and factor signals were established, including spectral decomposition components, peak positions, and long-range correlation strength. Using methods such as LSTM, LNG futures return predictions were made, incorporating indicators like the Hurst exponent to achieve strategy switching and window smoothing. The backtest results showed an annualized return rate exceeding 36%.

          This research presents a zero-shot OCT segmentation method that overcomes the limitations of traditional deep learning approaches, which require re-labeling and retraining for unseen Regions of Interest (ROIs). The method only needs box or point prompts for ROIs in the first frame, enabling automatic segmentation in subsequent frames.
